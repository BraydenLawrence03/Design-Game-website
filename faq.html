        <div class="q1">
            <p2 class="ok">What is the goal of this game? </p2>
            <p>The main idea of this game is to advance your way through the different levels that 
                represent a different theme, from a jungle-like atmosphere to the coral reefs. We've
                got it all! Eventually, after avoiding many lethal spikes and menacing enemies you will 
                obtain the crown at the final level.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="q2">
            <p2 class="ok">Are there any cool secrets in this game?</p2>
            <p>Yes, we have many easter eggs that can be found all across the map! There are many hidden
                blocks that will reward you with more shiny coins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="q3">
            <p2 class="ok">Are there any tricks to dodge the enemies and make it easier?
            </p2>
            <p>Yes, for sure! You can click shift which will make you dash past the enemies in a fast
                motion. It can also help you out to get to spaces on the map which are usually 
                unobtainable without this power up and as a result you get more coins. There are 
                consequences to dashing too much though, because you can accidentally run into a spike 
or an enemy if you're not careful.</p>

        <div class="q4">
            <p2 class="ok">How many levels are there? How much does it take to complete to obtain the
                crown?</p2>
            <p>It takes 9 levels including a tutorial to complete this game. Each one gets harder as
                there are more enemies and spikes that start to spawn and the maps get bigger with more 
                exits to get through it.</p>
